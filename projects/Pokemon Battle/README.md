# Pokemon Battle

## Description

A terminal Pokemon game. I decided to go above and beyond on this project, I wanted to see if I could provide random default values for the user. It gave me a change to learn hove to work with SQLite in Java.

## Hardest Part

By far the hardest part of this project was the logic. Decide to provide defaults complicated the logic of asking for inputs a ton. It was so complicated I ended up learning to write tests, so I could make sure every use case worked.
