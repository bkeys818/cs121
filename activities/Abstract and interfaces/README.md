# Abstract and interfaces

## Description

An introduction to using `extends` on interfaces and abstract classes.

## Hardest Part

I work in primarily Typescript, so I'm comfortable with interfaces, but the syntax for abstract classes is new. I'm going to have to remember the `abstract` keyword before abstract methods.
